# Pet Sitter API

Demo Spring Boot implementation of the Pet Sitter API from _"Designing APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI"_ Ponelat, J.S., 
Rosenstock, L.L. (2022).

We assume the domain model and a slightly modified version of the OpenAPI contract described at the end of Part 2. The
focus of this implementation is software design. In particular how to use concepts from Domain Driven Design to connect
the domain model and implementation.

Note, this application is intended for demonstration purposes. It is not a production ready application, nor is it an
enterprise grade application. The implementation reflects this. For further background [see](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/managing-complexity-contract-first-api-peter-ogunmade-whgoc "Linkedin article").
